# Mini-Project
### **Project Title:**

**Fan Speed Control System for Poultry Farm using Raspberry Pi Pico**

### **Project Description:**

This project aims to design and implement an **automatic fan speed control system** to maintain an optimal environment inside a poultry farm. Poultry birds are highly sensitive to temperature fluctuations, and maintaining a stable climate is crucial for their health, growth, and productivity.

The system uses a **DHT11 temperature sensor** to continuously monitor the ambient temperature inside the farm. The data is processed by a **Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller**, which adjusts the **fan speed** accordingly. When the temperature rises above the threshold, the fan speed increases; when the temperature decreases, the fan slows down. This ensures that the farm remains within the desired temperature range while conserving energy.

An **OLED display** (optional) can be used to show the current temperature and fan speed status in real time. By automating fan control, this project reduces the need for manual intervention, ensures a healthy environment for poultry, and improves energy efficiency.

### **Key Features:**

* Continuous temperature monitoring using **DHT11 sensor**
* Automatic **fan speed adjustment** based on temperature
* Control system implemented on **Raspberry Pi Pico**
* Real-time feedback through an **OLED display** (optional)
* Energy-efficient and reliable climate management solution

### **Applications:**

* Poultry farms and livestock management
* Greenhouses and agricultural environments
* Smart farming and climate control systems
